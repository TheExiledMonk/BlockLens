BlockLens
=========

This allows for searching information contained in Bitcoin and other digital currency blockchains using familiar web-search expressions and simple well-defined, server configurations

New uses are constantly being developed and applied to blockchains beyond the initial protocols' scope. Existing blockexplorers cover only basic address balance and transaction history and not informational / navigational search. BlockLens commands include message construction, transaction parsing, accounting and auditing funds / data, condition-based actions and notification alerts, search queries, sorting micro / metadata, network-relational mapping and counter-tracing.
